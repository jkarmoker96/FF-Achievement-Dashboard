The FF Achievement Dashboard is a comprehensive LOOKER-developed dashboard to monitor sales performance and target achievements across various NSMs, and RSMs. It highlights key metrics such as total sales target, month-to-date (MTD) sales, achievement percentage, trend percentage, daily sales target, and chemist coverage. The dashboard provides an intuitive filtering system to view performance by specific teams, such as Chronic Care, General Team, Hormone Team, Ophthalmic Team, and Wholesale. It includes a detailed NSM-wise analysis, comparing targets against sales values, achievement percentages, and trends. With tabular data and visual bar charts, the dashboard empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, track progress, and align strategies with organizational goals.
FF Achievement Brand-wise is the same as the previous report. Only a Brand filter was added to their brand-wise performance.
